Developed this project as a semester Term Project for the owner of an electronics shop using C# .Net. 

The client wanted to maintain his data related to stock he possess and the amount of profit he is generating from his business. The shop comprises of almost 400 electronic items i.e. washing machine, fan and water cooler etc. from 12 to 15 different vendor companies. 

The developed system maintained the type and quantity of items related to particular vendor company. The system has a single admin account used by the shop owner and possesses the capability to add multiple salesman accounts. The salesman can login into the system and generate bill for a particular customer. The shop owner has the capability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations. The database for this system was designed using ADO .Net.
